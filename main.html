       <h1 class="text-warning text-center bg-dark">Introduction to Bootstrap</h1> 
       <p class="text-secondary">Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that simplifies web development by providing pre-designed components, responsive layouts, and customizable design elements. It was initially developed by Twitter and has since become widely used for building modern, mobile-first websites quickly and efficiently. Bootstrap offers a grid system, responsive breakpoints, and a wide range of reusable HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components like navigation bars, modals, buttons, forms, and more. Its primary goal is to help developers create consistent, visually appealing websites that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes without needing to write extensive custom CSS.
       </p>
       <p class="text-info"><span>One of the key advantages of Bootstrap is its ease of use and extensive documentation, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced developers. By using pre-built components, developers can rapidly prototype websites and applications while maintaining clean, maintainable code. Bootstrap also promotes responsive design, allowing web pages to adjust smoothly to various devices, from desktops to smartphones. Additionally, the framework supports customization through its built-in SASS variables, enabling developers to easily modify the default styles to match their specific design needs. Overall, Bootstrap accelerates the development process and ensures a consistent user experience across different platforms.
